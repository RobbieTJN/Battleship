# Battleship

This is my solution to the Battleship coding problem.

Requirements for the challenge:

* Two Players
* Two Boards (one for each player)
* 1 Ship, with a length of 3 spaces, that can be placed vertically or horizontally
* Fire a single shot per turn (hit, miss, or sunk)
* If a ship has sunk, register a "You sank my Battleship" message
